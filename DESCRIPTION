Description:
  A suite of functions to compute confidence intervals and necessary
  sample sizes for the parameter p of the Bernoulli B(p)
  distribution under simple random sampling or under pooled
  sampling. Such computations are e.g. of interest when investigating
  the incidence or prevalence in populations.
  The package contains functions to compute coverage probabilities and
  coverage coefficients of the provided confidence intervals
  procedures. Sample size calculations are based on expected length.
